 forager_construction_phase_wood.1.d:0 "Through exploring the countryside outside of the Construction Site, our Foragers were able to discover a small abandoned sawmill, located on the perimeter of a nearby forest. Our Foragers report that the exterior of the building shows significant signs of decay and upon further inspection, much of the foundational wooden planks that made up the dilapilated building showed signs of advanced rot. For this reason, our Foragers did not enter the Sawmill, for fear it would collapse upon them.                                                                                                                                                                          Fortunately for us however, a tarp covering a large collection of wooden planks lay just around the back of the Sawmill, untouched. Our Foragers are readying to transport the retrieved supplies back to the Site. "

 construction_phase_order_worker.1.d:0 "A whistle shrieks and a station master shouts as a passenger train pulls into the site’s station, bringing with it the newest personnel ordered for the site. As the locomotive comes to a halt, and a team of men go about supplying it with fresh water and coal, the doors of its passenger carriages fling open and a heaving mob of workers spill out onto the platform. The labourers, clad in common clothing, range from sotic burly men with years of experience behind their stony faces to lanky fresh faced youths who look as if a hammer would be foreign to them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Nevertheless, they are all eager to work and are promptly led off down to the site to do just that, while a company clerk seeks out a signature." 

 construction_phase_order_guard.1.d:0 "A whistle shrieks and a station master shouts as a passenger train pulls into the site’s station, bringing with it the newest personnel. Snow melts as it falls on the boiling steel engine of the train, the carriage doors rapidly opening. Those who first step off the train and onto the station’s platform are a collection of brawny Sergeants, who begin to shout out orders to the men who follow. Soldiers, uniformed and armed, begin to disembark, eyes wearily scanning the horizon.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Soon enough the assembly of troops, most of them veterans of conflicts past, marched orderly into the site followed by crates of ammunition and weaponry. All that is left is a company clerk seeking a signature."

 construction_phase_order_engineer.1.d:0 "A whistle shrieks and a station master shouts as a passenger train pulls into the site’s station, bringing with it the newly ordered personnel. The driver yells for a quick turn around as he is already late and the passenger carriage doors are methodically opened.                                                                                                                                                                                                             A band of academic looking men and women step onto the platform, regarding the site in the distance with great curiosity, with a few sharing facts about the generator and other pieces of company technology. As they stroll down towards the construction site, a company clerk, berated by the driver, demands a signature."
 
 construction_phase_order_medic.1.d:0 "A whistle shrieks and a station master shouts as a passenger train pulls into the site’s station, bringing with it the newest personnel ordered for the site. It is mostly a train carrying cargo destined to other sites, yet a lone passenger carriage trails at the end, it’s doors shuttering open. Exiting the train is a small group of finely dressed doctors and nurses, who are evidently rather repulsed by the smells of the site, despite the assurances from the workers retrieving their luggage that they will get used to it.                                                                                                                                                                            As they are led away by a site bureaucrat to the beating heart of the operation, a company clerk asks plotileity for a signature."
